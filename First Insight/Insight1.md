This query looks at how many bike racks are in each borough and how evenly they're spread out across community districts. It also finds the average location of the racks. By checking which boroughs have the most racks per community district, we can see where bike parking is most available. This helps us figure out which areas might need more racks and how well the current installation programs are doing. Itâ€™s a simple way to spot patterns and make better decisions for future bike rack installations.
